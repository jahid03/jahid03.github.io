bio: |
  I am a Materials and Metallurgical Engineering graduate with strong academic training in physical metallurgy, corrosion engineering, thermodynamics, and hydrometallurgical processes. My primary interest lies in understanding the microstructure–property–performance relationship of engineering materials and developing sustainable material solutions for industrial applications.Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have developed analytical problem-solving skills, laboratory experience, and a strong foundation in materials characterization and process analysis. I am particularly interested in advanced materials research, green corrosion inhibitors, and sustainable extraction technologies. I aim to pursue graduate research in North America or Europe, focusing on innovative and environmentally responsible materials engineering.

    summary: |
      During my 3-week Engineering Internship at BSRM Ltd., I gained practical exposure to major steel manufacturing operations, including melting, rolling, and quality control. I assisted engineers in monitoring daily production activities, collecting process parameters, and understanding workflow optimization across different units. I also observed material testing procedures such as tensile testing, hardness measurement, and chemical analysis in the QC laboratory. Throughout the internship, I developed a strong understanding of industrial safety practices, large-scale manufacturing systems, and the practical application of core metallurgical engineering concepts.
